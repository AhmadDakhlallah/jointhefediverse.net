                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> is <mark>vast</mark>. It's made up of thousands of communities with millions of people like you and me, wanting to <mark>connect and share</mark>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a few resources that will help you get a better idea of how things work, how to find a community that's right for you, and explore tools you can use to make your experience even better.

            <p id="faq-instance" class="lead">Q: What is an "instance"? How do I pick one?</p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Each fediverse network is made up of <mark>"instances"</mark>, or <mark>"servers"</mark>. For example, if you want to join <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, you can sign up for an account on <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a> or  <a href="https://mas.to">mas.to</a>, or <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers">any other Mastodon server</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can even <a href="https://stefanbohacek.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-running-a-single-person-mastodon-instance/#hosting">run your own server</a>, <a href="https://stefanbohacek.online/about">like I do</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving between different instances is easy, and you'll be able to <mark>carry your friends and followers with you</mark>, so don't worry about picking the right instance from the start. Just sign up, feel things out, and you can move to another instance, or another network altogether, if you find a better fit.
                
            </p>
            <p id="faq-instance" class="lead">Q: What is "decentralized social media"? Why is it good?</p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Remember when <a href="https://botwiki.org/blog/elon-musk-steps-in-as-the-new-owner-of-twitter/">Elon Musk bought Twitter</a> and started changing things that drew a lot of people away? This is a lot less likely to happen with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network">social media sites that run across many servers</a>, because you'd have to buy all of them to control the whole network. And people can keep creating new ones.
            </p>
            <p id="faq-funding" class="lead">Q: Is the fediverse free to join? Who pays for these servers?</p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Yes, joining any of the servers is typically free. Communities are maintained and moderated by <mark>volunteers</mark>, often paying for hosting from their own pocket. If you can afford it, and there is an option to do so, consider supporting them with a <mark>donation</mark>.  
            </p>
            <p id="faq-funding" class="lead">Q: What rules do I have to follow?</p>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> That depends on the <mark>community</mark>. Each server can set their own rules, but generally it's important to treat other members of the community with <mark>kindness and respect</mark>. A few things to remember: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><mark>caption your images</mark>, so that those who can't see them still get to enjoy them</li>
                <li>use <mark>hashtags</mark> generously, this is how others can find your posts</li>
                <li>if your server has this features, use <mark>content warnings</mark> as appropriate</li>
                <li>if you see something wrong, <mark>report it to the admins</mark></li>
            </ul>
